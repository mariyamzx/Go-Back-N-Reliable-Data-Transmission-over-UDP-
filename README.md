# Go-Back-N-Reliable-Data-Transmission-over-UDP-
This project demonstrates a custom implementation of the Go-Back-N (GBN) protocol using UDP sockets in Python. It simulates reliable data transfer over an unreliable channel by introducing features like packet loss, corruption, timeout, retransmissions, and acknowledgements (ACK/NAK).
